==========================
Installing django-messages
==========================

Basically all you have to do is get the ``messages`` folder somewhere on the
Python path. There are multiple ways to achive this.

Quickstart
----------

If you already downloaded the package change into the ``django-messages``
directory and run::

    python setup.py install

Otherwise you will find more information in the remainder of this document.

Django-messages is available via PyPi, so the following command will download
and install django-messages on your system in one step::

    easy_install django-messages

If you prefer using pip, you may achieve the same result by running::

    pip install django-messages


Download
---------

You will always find and download the latest packaged version at:
http://code.google.com/p/django-messages/downloads/list

If you prefer to use the current developement version to get earlier access to
new features you can checkout the code from the GIT repository::

    git clone https://github.com/arneb/django-messages.git


Install
-------

If you downloaded the tar-ball extract it with (change the version number if
required)::

    tar -xcvf django-messages-0.4.tar.gz

After extracting the tar-ball or checking out the code from the repository,
change into the ``django-messages`` directory and install the code::

    cd django-messages
    python setup.py install


Manual Install
--------------

Instead of using ``setup.py install`` it is also possible to copy or symlink
the ``django_messages`` folder inside the toplevel ``django-messages`` folder
to your Python path. This will be enough to make djano-messages available to
your system.


Dependencies
------------

Django-messages has no external dependencies except for django. However, if
pinax-notifications and/or django-mailer are found, it will make use of them.

Please note, that these apps have to be listed in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` to be
used by django-messages.

* If you use `pinax-notifications`_ django-messages will use it for sending
  notifications to users about new messages instead of using the built-in
  mechanism.

* If `django-mailer`_ is used the built-in messages sending code will use it
  instead of the django built-in ``send_mail`` function.
